# Realman RM65-B Robot Simulation

## Current Implementation (May 23, 2025)

**Asset Pipeline**
- USD from URDF conversion
- Robot asset loading into scene
- Transform configuration (position/rotation)

**Robot Control**
- 6-DOF articulation setup
- RmpFlow motion planning integration
- Real-time end-effector control

**Target Following**
- Visual target cube creation
- Dynamic pose tracking
- Collision-aware motion generation

**Simulation Features**
- Headless mode with WebRTC streaming
- 60 FPS real-time execution
- Modular, well-documented codebase

## Next Steps

- Interactive control (keyboard/mouse target manipulation)
- Multi-obstacle collision avoidance scenarios
- Pick & place operations with gripper integration
- ML integration for motion optimization
